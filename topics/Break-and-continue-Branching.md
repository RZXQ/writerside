# Break and continue. Branching

In certain cases, you may want to alter the standard behavior of a loop. The Java programming language provides **[branching statements](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/3507)** for this purpose that can terminate a loop or skip some of its iterations. Proper use of these statements is essential for writing clear, organized, and efficient code.

## The break statement

The **break** statement has two uses:

- it terminates the current loop of any type (**for**, **while**, **do-while**);
- it terminates a case in the **switch** statement;

In this topic, we will learn how to use it to terminate loops.

The following example demonstrates a loop that includes one `break`.

```java
int i = 10;
while (true) { // the condition to continue the loop
    if (i == 0) { // the condition to perform the break that stops this loop 
        break;
    }
    i--;
}
```

In the code above, the condition to continue the loop is always `true`, but it will be successfully stopped when the variable `i` becomes `0` through the use of `break` inside the conditional statement.

The **break** statement terminates only the loop in which it is currently located. If this loop is performed inside another loop, the outer loop won't be stopped.

The following code prints a ladder of numbers.

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
        System.out.print(j + " ");
        if (i == j) {
            break;
        }
    }
    System.out.println();
}
```

The break statement can't stop the outer loop (with variable `i`) and the code prints:

```java
0 
0 1 
0 1 2 
0 1 2 3 
0 1 2 3 4 
0 1 2 3 4 5 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
```

To stop the outer loop we could declare a Boolean variable `stopped` and use it as a special Boolean flag.

```java
boolean stopped = false;
for (int i = 0; i < 10 && !stopped; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
        System.out.print(j + " ");
        if (i == j) {
            stopped = true;
            break;
        }
     }
    System.out.println();
}
```

Now, the program's output is not the same:

```java
0
```

There is another way to stop the outer loop: the labeled break operator. However, it's not good practice to use it. Google it if you are really interested.

Here's an example demonstrating the use of `break`with a label:

```java
outerLoop:
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
        System.out.print(j + " ");
        if (i == j) {
            break outerLoop; // Break out of both loops.
        }
    }
    System.out.println();
}
```



## The continue statement

It causes a loop to skip the current iteration and go to the next one.

This statement can be used inside any kind of loop.

- inside the **for-loop**, the continue statement causes control to immediately move to the increment/decrement statement;
- inside the **while** or **[do-while loop](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/3507)**, control immediately moves to the condition.

In the following example, a sequence of numbers is output. Odd numbers are skipped.

```java
int n = 10;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (i % 2 != 0) {
        continue;
    }
    System.out.print(i + " ");
}
```

The output:

```java
0 2 4 6 8
```

The **continue** statement and the **break** statement only affect the loop in which they are located. The **continue** statement cannot skip the current iteration of the outer loop.

Often, we can rewrite our loop without using the continue statement. Here is an example:

```java
int n = 10;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { 
    if (i % 2 == 0) {
        System.out.print(i + " ");
    } 
}
```

The result is the same as above, but the code became shorter and more readable.

It is important to note that the widespread use of branching statements leads to poorly-structured code because conditions in your loops are not actually what you need to do. So, use them wisely â€” only when it helps to make code shorter and easier to understand for humans.

## Conclusion

The **break** statement allows for the termination of loops or switch cases based on certain conditions. It can be a valuable tool for controlling the flow of your program, especially when you need to exit loops prematurely. On the other hand, the continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next one. It is useful for situations where you want to skip specific iterations based on certain conditions. However, it's essential to exercise caution when using these statements. Overuse of branching statements can lead to code that is challenging to read and maintain. Therefore, it's recommended to employ them sparingly, primarily when it enhances code clarity and conciseness.
